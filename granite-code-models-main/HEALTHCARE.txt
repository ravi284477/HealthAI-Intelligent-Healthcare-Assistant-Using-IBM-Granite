 🧠 Abstract
 HealthAI is a real-time intelligent healthcare assistant that enables users to interact with an
 AI system to receive health-related information. Built with Python, Streamlit, and OpenAI,
 the system offers personalized responses to health queries, provides AI-powered disease
 predictions based on symptoms, suggests treatment guidelines, and visualizes patient data
 through insightful graphs. It serves as an educational and awareness tool, empowering
 users to make informed decisions about their health.







Ị Problem Statement
Access to timely and professional medical advice remains a challenge for many, especially in
rural and underserved communities. HealthAI aims to bridge this gap by offering a virtual
assistant capable of providing preliminary health guidance, improving awareness, and
reducing dependence on overburdened healthcare systems. It acts as a first point of
reference before seeking clinical care.
